# game-of-life

React version of Conway's Game of Life

_WARNING: THIS CODE IS OPTIMIZED TO MINIMIZE LINES, NOT TO UNDERSTAND_

Features:

-   Including styles and functionality (but not react boilerplate) 50 lines of
    code!
-   Optimized with canvas. Still performant up to the maximum array length
    allowed by JS. Somewhere around a million pixels.
-   Styled with react and styled components
-   Click on each cell to toggle its value for that period
-   Uses a URL parser to edit default setting:
    `https://jovial-shannon-5d8778.netlify.com/?cellcount=1100&delay=1200` sets
    total cell count to `1100` and delay between ticks to `1200` ms. Defaults
    are 1000 each
